# LibraryManagementSystem

To whoever reads this,

For this to be first project, when I previously had no skills or knowledge about coding, you have put me through hell!

Haha, jokes aside, I am really proud of what I've managed to do, through countless research amongst sleepless nights,
I can say I have enjoyed the process of making the library management system.

What has surprised me most was how I would come up with complex code, not even fully realizing what I'm doing, to just breaking it down
and the code becoming much more simple and clean as I do so.

The most important thing I've learnt was understanding how to plan; from the structure of the GUI, its design, planning the functions, database, etc. Without a plan, one could easily become lost and have no way of reaching their end goal. Whilst that paints programming in a more 'do-or-die'-esque light, it most definitely has brought some insight into what its like being a programmer/software engineer.

I know the work is only going to get harder, but I am confident I will continue to improve!

Thanks for reading,

*Note:
Unfortunately i was not sure of how to make a reset button/command which restores the logfile.txt to the original
template.

Also, if search is too general, the search function will display the first book with the same words/characters,
e.g by typing "a", the first book that uses letter 'a' will be displayed as opposed to a word that starts with a.
